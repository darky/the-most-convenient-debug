* ▶️ Step-by-step debugger in IDE
* 🔙 Maybe even time-travel debugger
* 📜 Viewing logs

#### 🖨️ Print some variable value to stdout

* 🐌 Low debug performance
* ↔️ Context switch between your code and stdout
* 🔁 Often need to rerun your program again and again

#### ▶️ Step-by-step debugger in IDE

* 🐌 Low debug performance
* 🔁 Often need to rerun your program again and again

#### 🔙 Time-travel debugger

* 🏋️ Often very hard to implement
